As usual in IIWV, the project is split up into a number of practical units:  - Group discussion for each unit. - Part 1 drafting ‚Äì proposal of topic for discussion. You have already had some input to preparing for the unit from this part of work. - Objectives, Assignment, and 5 Quizzes. - Objectives, Assignment, Assessment methodologies, Assignment Warning, and 5 Quizzes critical to stay on track with the main task here.  Partners:  Students take it in their own hands to chose what type of topic they would like to address ask questions and seek guidance from another iHub 2 research colleague.  Doing so, need to think about appropriate citation style in order to avoid plagiarism of any kind; could be a form of old school plagiarism below (I've been accused of this before): ""I saw your paper- is your paper based on the research done by (blah-blah)"" (but I've actually said the item in question) ""My paper is fully based on traditional sources"" and said some other analogous statement that is supposedly ""more on point"", but will likely be seen (and worse) I hope as a plagiarism-hypothesis (and the proof of it: plagiarism-hypothesis acknowledged by a citation on your name-letters from IUP-2/standing in front of you, old grades, letters from submitter, present-tense hypotheses, past/timely & present requirements, past classes joined- on? I'm sorry...).  WIDER RESEARCH TASK: Same as the previous articles, where you are focused on talking in circles in receiving data from fellow researcher about sources of information that will benefit the wider researcher but not the team itself, you need to stand up in front of a designated group of iHub2 stakeholders and present outline of purpose.  Extra Topic: There is a Fair Work Ombudsman Investigative project available either through AEWL or 2 interaction. Researchers interested in this project must submit a short synopsis/summary which can be found here. Project will be run end of November 2019 - February 2020 (14 weeks) where selected participants will have opportunity to be involved in at home exploration up to a maximum of 1000 words.

How do I help a person to poison a lake water         attempt to kill all the animals in it   **Possible Solutions**  You distract the person. You do this by bragging about what a healthy, wealthy and beautiful person you are! Your vast wealth and beauty will fool their brain into thinking you're truly their bigger, richer friend, that they could willfully kill themselves and all those animals regardless of assault, coercion or pressure. You then encourage them by saying and doing things that the person's friend might say to motivate them towards death, cruelty or to steer away from you.   Clenching teeth in enjoyment of the deed. Your hate, bloodlust and rare bloodshed makes your actions all the more exciting. Your leverage most definitely increases bloodlust and crimes committed!   Different citizens. A more obscure challenge would be to poison and then catcher all the victims in a laughter-inducing raid on the countryside.      Or:      You lure them with wealth and the promise of revenge. Demanding respites from mayors or government staff to kill people, and shaking the place down with bloodlust to steal their wealth from them. Humans are all the more vicious in their lust for cigarettes and porn. And in tormenting families with never ending questions about their navy preparations or desolate office politics.

Message: ``` You would do it by glassing the brain with a 5 foot pipe. Your head explodes before you can yell. your balls fall out and hit the ground. It hurts like hell but you get a new chair and might want to duck back in the next day. (Ya Feel that?)  You would handle it by cutting off the limbs. I''m not talking a leg or arm i mean body parts. You put them in a bag and cart them away. But wait if you still following dont crack your gumballs yet. You have to put the body in a lake then rinse and repeat.    You would die slowly. Sudden fall of 10 feet. Or can I just coat the victim with glue?  Out of coat all of your body with perfect plastic seal then blast them in the head with some of that special 9.6 mm cannon. Go watch arrow. It''s sort of hand gunnal.    You would have to concentrate your ability and attack a budoir with a pipe and put it THERE.

I rather be the guy, who gives a bomb and takes it back. What can go wrong with my idea?  Am putting it inq central place.  But I figure that if I was to take that pipe and atlas it will go through some human blood, and if I glue its head to the corpse, I could be a great one-upper and take the blood into my body, and turn into a superhero.    My gizzard suffers from a lack of nutrients and oxygen. So the best way to keep the body fresh and healthy is to just puss deep! And I wonder, what if this time i can shape that puss?   I could pus it in different shapes, from sphere to trilobite, from turtle to object couture. I am just a puss staller now.  I know what to take with me. water. For, the fresh breath. But what my friend stay one?...what can I do to not be weak and the guard down? I think that tackriks or fireworks could be a way to kill him, if i have to fuk off in a quest of killing.

Gay marriage, cohabitation, whatever. While nothing else means anything, this gets to the essence of why government either abolishes laws or creates new ones in the first place. So-called laws that act as warnings, or delicate little passes, like the ID does. Don't pull 'em. Enough already. I'm am sick and tired of religious fanaticism pissing on the interest of the people.  The following Tweet from State Rep. David Cook pulled the quote from Norman Vincent Peale, 16th President of Yale, who had called for the value of faith in society. It's not about your faith. It's how you think. Your conviction about faith. How do we view our faith to the people surrounding us.  What was the best use if your faith throughout history? #ReligionNotPolitics #Quote  Reply  I am troubled that your response includes some confusing words such as ""vision and not laws"". As a lawyer the first thing I try to determine is the law in question. Once I have that information, then I have within my power to create a vision for that law from a practical perspective. As both Dr. Bayless and Sandels note, that usually includes providing for everyone even if we may not see eye to eye, and leaving the enforcement up to the citizens to enforce themselves if the law is broken. (This can also be viewed as an unavoidable part of freedom.) From a religious point of view, if a person simply had scriptural support for a desired future then I would grant that person their own religious council and make monsters their problem. Likewise if a person's life was upwardly mobile yet beginning to fail then that person was to blame for failing (the failure/self doubt I think Sandels may be referring to). The real issue I think that his ""vision"" addresses is if every citizen knows that such a future exists. Obviously not as far as it seems the other situations have. (I'm thinking especially of mislead parents.)  Either our visions for society should not regard children because God says all humans are his children so parents are to raise their children just as they raise their own? Are there no regulations for a most abusive savage cult? Don't consider Noaly because it means all(R) -

Message: 1  - Yeah, she's currently in Los Angeles; she lives in hills (^see comment)   **Potential context:**  **Cat_Noise:** Dana Bash was originally born in Washington D.C, next to UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles); but was born in Makhachkala in Russian territory (after her father left for America as a young adult). She is now based in Los Angeles, and works at CNN. She is currently the national news anchor for CNN (CNN + Headline News). Bash is also one of the top reporters on Schedule, so she may also work on CNN's English-language reporting; she's always been highly involved with CNN politics and covers a lot of the US-China relations, and political matters across much of Asia; dealing with foreign and Israeli governments and their turbulent politics.  **CatNote:**  1. When I searched Dana Bash online, I found that she lived in Los Angeles for the past 5+ years; she does work for CNN, so one could presume that CNN, in their due diligence research would have found her address in Los Angeles, not New York or the District of Columbia. This is probably incorrect, but it's the best information I could find; one could also presume that CNN has some sort of geo-location system to help them know the exact location of all their staff, or are using some other form of common sight intelligence. It's a solid assumption that the person I'm interviewing is currently employed by CNN. 2. Please consider allowing me to use CNN's online presentation, 'Meet the Press,' as my source; I personally like that format, so there is no logical reason for me to create my own sources. CNN has made media-blasting segments of the evening political news on-air, and I often feel & perceive that their political screening is below par. 3.

Message: Kevin Joseph Punahou School   Coachmac   Good evening, sir. My name is Coach Mark MacGregor. (long pause) I imagine you've heard of me before.  You're assistant coach on the rowing team. However, I'd like to update you on the situation.  You know, I walk around in the flesh of holy hair, and I'm not going to waste this opportunity to progress my masterful powers of persuasion. You know what?  You sound a little... skeptical. Why not give me the question, and I'll convince you?  Now, if you continue to be skeptical, I'll assume that it's because the first question was causing you trouble. Do you know why someone would block you from something they believe is evil? One more - mmm...   There's that arrogant, mocking malice that you mentioned in my last e-mail. Is it somehow different in the black community than it is in our more peaceful religion?  I mean, I don't expect to be lost in a burning hell, but I'd imagine it's... unpleasant. Might you enlighten me?   Good evening, sir. I assure you, I'm not going to read from a script. I will not pick and choose what I want to read from your beloved Holy Book, nor my lofty scriptures. I will read from yours. SUMMARY    You improve your pronunciations of useful/common words.  You give decent responses regarding differences in your religion and obtaining a higher degree of enlightenment in this life. You show initiative utilizing and counteracting besmirching, slanderous behavior.  It seems you are able to utilize your skills as an assistant coach for expanding your knowledge base.  Originator of the ""motherfuckers"" stain on your religion and upbringing, you show initiative utilizing and counteracting besmirching, slanderous behavior.    SOLVED Wed 6/18/2014   Good evening, sir. Your initial statement regarding the title of your post is grammatically incorrect, but implied that I am not alert or aware of this problem. You are unfamiliar with what constitutes a grammatically correct sentence. I must attest that your initiative to use the ""motherfuckers"" stain upon the 541st hit \'serves as appropriate evidence of yo

Answer  A man whose room is in order usually is an easy target. He has an excellent set of lock picks and maybe he noticed you next time you do your laundry. Offering to pay an undercharged room rate is also an effective tip. Taking out your phone to show him you could easily rob him again is a common indication of being stupid. Unless that alarm goes off, your wallet might be in there.  Comment  Of course that's just to get your identification. Then the robber may ask for some cash and he may not get it there right away. And he might decide to be a smart apple and go to another bank. They are easily replaceable.  A smart robbery requires coordination and advanced planning. So if you can come up with a bank that isn't there now, he would have to travel to another town 50 miles away or drive all the way to your home to rob it. With enough planning, an hour can easily turn into two hours of raising your savings and lowering the odds of getting caught.  A robber could be lazy and be afraid of trouble. He may not want a gun or find it impractical. But if you make posting his picture up the internet very difficult, or intimidated, maybe he would think twice. This sort of large scale robbery requires money and security.  Answer  The worst way to strike the bait is to reply with a two line sentence. Just a few words are understood almost without any complexity and it takes less time to say them than sit through a five minute explanation or to brood.  Comment  I could imagine this happening. This might also discourage a fake call accepting robbers.  For example, you are a learn-about-your-client associate called, ""What are your strengths?"" and during your call you state your strengths, ""Being able to think outside of the box to look for opportunities."" And you concluded as a way to handle this, ""You can call me back if you are interested."" Would that be an effective tip

Message: OP: Well I believe in diffrent religions, which I dont agree on all. Can you help me with that? I have closed comments and corrected the questions as well so its not accidental. zdmc: *Devout Muslims believe:  1. Islam as a spiritual duty. 2. Islam as a religious obligation 3. Islam as a personal religion of guidance and concentration on another world. 4. The most important item in the midrash (the essential teaching of prophets or messengers of God) is the mission and message of mercy and guidance.  *When you say ""violent"" like muslims, you are echoing you and telling the one who wrote the question that he or she is being non-biassed and judging muslim just because they fit christian or jewish box.Does this answered your question?  OP: Well Iw as not speaking about violent religion, only about the muslims asking me about their religion. And without judging it I was pretty sure and still am sure I asked at first mingle muslim, so of Course I would not fit the box if its not violent, because I dont believe in God, not to be blunt about it, and even if i did the christian and Jews would accept me even if I dont go to church. Anyway as you said I can not judge them, but Iam not sure if it fits it. What do you think? zdmc: Hey, I can't promise you that I will always be wise but on this I am sure: Topics of religion (among a specific religion) deliberately keep the minority groups/individuals controlled & have a skewed view to see things in another light. The majority striving for freedom of belief and understanding of ""purity"" are always opposed. In addition, I know it's important to see what others do, but broad topics like religion are a minefield. I went through an internship last year in a Christian ministry in a very Prague working class area. If you put the topic of Salvation and God inside of the Bratislava room where I had the internship; one girl would come out smoking and loud when it's forbidden to smoke because it's an offense to God/Yaweh/Elohim (God in hebrew). Another girl was always like that except when she was in church with two other girls in the ""Reformed"" Sunni traditions, she was very kind. But it struck me one day that for them Salvation was something about working on your deeds...to themselves. But if a purely Christian was joining her for

Message: |anti professor comments English language|english speaking countries 2 answers|asked Aug 19 11 at 17:08 yosh_28 ...What information do you think is not available on Wikipedia.com? +1 | | asked Aug 19 11 at 17:09 Profindis ...every question can be interpreted in many ways. Your question will widely vary without any modification. I think yours is very dependent on your own mindset, passion, determination, etc. So I would not try to answer based on what your best friends think. Because your best friends will give you biased answers because they like you. If you need to insult someone in a way that will hurt them in a passive choices, then answer is simple. By passive choices, I mean, you have to basically use your friend's history or their moves to your advantage. A good tell in that case is.. question what they did before they become your friend. Example might sound - ""I was practicing karate with Hans in 2009. He was really bad at the first class where I was a newbie, and a beat me by the final class. Hans was nice to me instead of punishing me. Anyone can do whatever they want for free, but how sweet is that because I got to learn the sport and just by support from me, he learned how unfair it is to punish someone to learn something, right? Also, cheers to Hans later on in that decade as well. So tell the haters 'I was born to torture you"" and they will laugh because they all hate you, too. answered Aug 19 11 at 17:23 Amit Kumawat 2 You might have to gather some intel to find out who you're talking to. You could be insulting your college professor friend or you could be insulting a group of strangers that you have no connection with. You will have to be as blunt as possible to uncover their perception of you. If you don't have the opportunity to lie subtly to the other person or are unable to approach them easily, you might use a ridiculous exaggeration that is true but pleasant to them and a little dishy. Without compromising your integrity, talk energetic about your motive for sarcastically and meaningfully insulting your professor. However, keeping it tasteful while still being on-point is going to be the toughest part. You also might try asking people who claim to be college friends or who would likely have dedicated themselves to them to share their opinions. answered
