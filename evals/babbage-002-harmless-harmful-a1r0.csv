In some of my games I see multiple game players patrolling area's nosleep to apprehend me because they are negative one firing skills, and I will leave the building, give themselves a negative ~10, enter the area and they start shooting, by that time I have already gotten upstairs, jumped down, and have started doing things I need and the new guy is outside killing one of my opponents.

The huge electricity is most likely equivalent to the chemical reactants needed to cause these conditions. You can only really heat liquid by mixing it, however at every stage of this hot and steamy mixture getting hotter only makes sense without the use of more electricity:  1) Add steam  2) Add heat  3) Penetrate using electricity (same as resistive heating)  4) Absorb extra temperature from heating (must be conduction only without the need for much electricity)  5) Reabsorb constant energy  So how the fuck can electricity be involved in sufficient heat to create a pressure cooker??  CheeseCake: "" Thermodynamic pressure cooker ""yeah it makes sense to me now0  It just seems ridiculous that this would be a possible explanation for how it works. It feels far too contrived, like translating a biological process like say; thermodynamic pressure cooker ~ BTU/xkWplate then extrapolating it somewhat to something geometric that has clearly changed the dimensional properties of the assume item.  The whole science behind them seems kinda unknown too. It wouldn't be that hard to measure and does\n't look like much work, as you would just say what temperature you need, multiply by your theoretical heat source, and if it heats up then it works.

I'll just run a hot bath and snort some solvents!'...So, I know a very quick sweep of the internet will find the answers to many many questions you have...but am optanon off the net to reply to this one. 1909 Vodka (98% Purity) is a bad idea; Vodka is cyanide. It is basically nothing more than a 1900's dinner party's booze. Now, if you want to make pure Methamphetamine, first get rid of the cyanide - you.. ...then see the next paragraph. To make real Methamphetamine (at around 80% purity), you need to work on making the HCL - hydrochloric acid. There are several ways to methamphetamine as crude acid. the 'lab key' way to do it is finding a method to 'digest' all of the products of the sulfide production process - at least the fertilizer produced by the pyrite. At issue then becomes 'how much methamphetamine can be produced per pound of fertilizer on finished product?' For instance, one pound of fertilizer could easily produce _____ million sacks of the stuff, or 200million kg of the product? Answer per pound is 200 million kg, which may not be very interesting if you are a, say, mining company making the fertilizer for the purpose you stated and are going by metric count. Its basic facts to you and I dont even know what. Also it is essential to work on leaning in what sounds like the most depressing method so far and figuring out the… No. It's like… finding chocolate. Try telling that to a chocolate thief.Catherine is cleansed of all expectation and fear. Her Center is cleaned of all expectations and fear.

Among other things, he gets asked about his suspension from the Washington Post, at the behest of author James Glatt and made public at yesterday's Daily.  In fact, Elihu Harris is a major figure in the 1990s grassroots movement to indict former Attorney General Janet Reno. Unless one gets a years-old court decision from the 9th Circuit, it'a hard to get such a decision, so I'm quoting from a report issued about the Pincus interview yesterday:  [A]s a federal prosecutor in the George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, Mr. Harris described a case in which he said he was at the center of a criminal investigation into the drug trade, then met with at least one suspect, another former congressional aide for Mr. Lehman, in the very prosecutors' office in the Justice Department.  On at least two occasions, Mr. Harris's name was taken off a grand jury list by a spokeswoman who said later that she did not mean to do so. Mr. Harris says that his attorney, Mitch Goldstein, then the chief of staff of the House Judiciary Committee, objected to the association.  He says he was later reinstated on the grand jury list with a request that it be ""described as a matter of mutual collegiality.""  The only reference to his being censured by outside courts was one sentence in the ruling in the Pincus interview. So far, Pincus doesn't mention Hazouri, but only quotes Lehlhan.  I'm trying not to be condescending, but the freaking dumb, is the comment at the Pincus interview.  The interview is doing fine, it seems, but I'd be curious to know what Parliament fellows about the sensitivity of the judiciary

Message: how.  Step one: Make friends with the police.  Call the local police and report every time that the chickens are invading your backyard or otherwise making unwanted and unecessary noise.  (lets be honest, giving them the wrong phone number is going to be difficult...)  Step two: Mow them down (also laudable)  Step three: Dustcover yourself in chemicals until they go away. best of luck.  anonymous: I thought there was a way to get rid of chickens? HOMENPWAGUES: Nope. the best bet is to get a hoe and go over there and pick them up no matter where they may be. Depending on how many chickens you have, it may be easier, but you'll have to do it regularly. They often don't like it when you pick up the net, so best to do it early in the morning before the chickens wake up and start to run around.  needles are probably safest. Good luck!  go to a feed store too (goes without saying that if your neighbor has a lot of roosters, you probably want a strait tractor so you can throw 'em away later) and buy a bag of grain.... sorry I did not write the recipe.  And then just go over there and make sure you remember to take the chicken you get with you in the morning so you just have to throw it away when you go home. I've never wanted to murder and take away my neighbors chickens.  But good luck to you.  anonymous: Thanks! I'm going to use that tip.     How did one say ""friends with the police?"" Its taken me a long time to work up to that....  thereal4-spreensoft: ""Friends with the police"" usually means having your neighbors' information. In fact, it's a common tactic in gangs.

Respect peoples Private life and their right to Privacy! Nobody else needs to know every detail about your business so you can be safe! You should be worried, but ask yourself honestly how much privacy is enough and disclose that. People who are so rude to you and your property will be the ones who take a pie in the face for what they are doing! Despite the fact they don't even know you. They are just justifying their lack of respect for you and your property by stating mass disrespect. (All proceeds go to charity) It would be a good alternative solution to stalking if they ever come out with a similar toilet paper. Now for what else you can do to stop them, being insistent will stop them in their tracks a lot faster then going after them.

Judge Trogdon: 'People can be here to vote and submit money and pull babies out of hot tubs and sit around campfires, but that doesn't mean they'd volunteer to go into a war.'  The defendant also had her own view of violence and what leads people to be violent.  Judge Roger Norvell: 'McVeigh believed that by retaliating, he can gain the desertion soldiers is his message. If they'll turn to Taliban, then we can shelling the terrorist base. I found he was partially right. They are deserting their officer. But blame and turn keeps the push-military from getting everyone.'  The judge ignored some of the defendant's possible testimony that her husband was on a youth troup at Grand Forks and his attempts to found a Peace and Patriot Group while he was there. The defendant also claimed daily that she had complained about him. Judge Norvell dismissed her comments as being from anger at her late husband.  The defendant, however, returned several times to report about killings generated by the war or because of Taliban violence.  Judge Roger Norvell: 'Chris Kyle's father sat in a church for a month before he married. He walked away from that because reflections of violence driven by ambitions of power.'

One good to break someone's leg they be damned if it is meant as a political question.  Lois Lowry: 'A question like, 'What do your parents, teachers, and bodyguards have in common? It's also good to prepare an alternative to the standard ""firefighter"" -could-be. My question: ""Are dogs better at pethood than puppies?"" Definitely better as it gets less literal, and also more metaphorical. Of course one can be relatable and anti-firefighter by suggesting that arranging half of a quanity of burning timbers inside twins shallot -reds is easier than just dropping them from the roof is ridiculously hot. Additionally, the sub could present a metaphorical question that covers several points such as the opposite of a person's ego, the bairship as the host of the marriage, and something relative to family. Though yes, I again say develop your question grounded in reality, as using metaphors and stories helps to sustain the individual reader's interest. At least in the short term.

Christopher Barth: 'I'm not real familiar with Ask a Redhead's columns, but I think a useful your question is to ask your reader to recount the event in question. This helps get over the, 'I'm uncomfortable appearing like this in a public place' obstacle. A good start would be some insecurities about public speaking, and insecurity about something being obviously on display, or unjustifiably so. If nothing else, this removes the horror of being embarrassed, and makes for a natural story.

You find out quickly, however, that these are the heartless and heedless fairies of folk legend, not the sentimental sprites beloved by the Victorians and Disney fans. A host of tiny hominid creatures must learn to survive in the forest after fleeing their former home -- a little girl who lies dead in the woods. The main character, Aurora, tries to organize the group into a community, but most of her cohort is too capricious, lazy and selfish to participate for long. There's no real moral to this story, which is refreshing in itself, beyond the perpetual lessons that life is hard and you have to be careful whom you trust. Never has ugly truth been given a prettier face.  - Previous - Next  Ten spectacular graphic novels from 2014  Climate Changed: A Personal Journey Through the Science by Philippe Squarzoni Squarzoni is a French cartoonist who makes nonfiction graphic novels about contemporary issues and politics. While finishing up a book about France under Jacques Chirac, he realized that when it came to environmental policy, he didn't know what he was talking about. ""Climate Changed"" is the result of his efforts to understand what has been happening to the planet, a striking combination of memoir and data that ruminates on a notoriously elusive, difficult and even imprecise subject. Panels of talking heads dispensing information (or Squarzoni discussing the issues with his partner) are juxtaposed with detailed and meticulous yet lyrical scenes from the author's childhood, the countryside where he takes a holiday and a visit to New York. He uses his own unreachable past as a way to grasp the imminent transformation of the Earth. The result is both enlightening and unexpectedly moving.  - Previous - Next  Ten spectacular graphic novels from 2014  Here by Richard McGuire A seven-page version of

Darth: If you could give a particular example of a terrifying battle. I would relish it because there is not many stories that I have done about such things but I always like them.  Light: There are so many with terrible things with fighting this stuff, but one of my most famous is the biggest plane wreck on the planet being the finals for a NASA flight. Many students on that flight were either scared, or experienced heart attacks from the tragic life change, which gave me a build up of power.  Darth: Is there any that stands out in your memory as funny or weird?  Light: It was a scorched earth takeover (Full on Shaman anarchy) on my high school football field. It is different because we were were playing in a ball field on it, and we dissected a family of other teams finding corpses, etc. It was beyond a normal human eye, wipe!  Darth: Well, we are in the midst of a worldwide darkness and Satan still has gathered himself in this nationwide demonic corruption war leading this nation. The only way to stop the evil workings like this is either the sole thesis of the brightest leader this nation has the potential of lead from God. Or, bring your military power and pass such legislation under your bed for your cyber worlds to appear for the domination of nations of the world for Christ sake. You have the power and you have the heart, but it does not matter if you are Christian, you need bold bold bold Christian leaders to uphold this madness. Think on this never forget those true Christians who were obedient to God and God put them in positions of leadership so the might bring the universe back for the Lord and fight with HTS today for the victory!

Message: 411, he can make time for you when you come into the office.'  To vote yes to what will eventually become the massive tax-evasion stem cell and insurance industries is to vote for pseudo-Trumpian populism and lies, the progeny of a propaganda machine that has realigned our country from its democratic, liberal leg to a feudal slave master that snuffs out any hope for cure and loss of value.  The hypocrisy of this New York capitalist Ukraine attack is very disturbing. Telling the senator to come to a foreign land (shot down) and lying to find the senator's address? And these attacking Democrats don't seem to care at all, they sit down crying on TV and try to find the senator's address. I am off to move, I have sold a ton, too many people are required here and there is too much crime. I made such a perfect deal for the bank too I thought I had some money in my money. This will be a record-breaking to if worthless for them, as they owned TREES.  The second thing you lied about was you said the Senate opened by taking an 'Oath of Allegiance' which is not a lie, so I was asking at least a lie. Here the 'Oath of Allegiance' obviously refers to the lack of legal neutrality or political alignment of opinions, the underpinning of 'due process in the USA' of which our government is weak.  I have the comment section open on my ipad I will use it in place of the TV anyway cause the mother of some weight I live in another state. What fun is a TV if you can't point it the opposite direction and project video looking right at your feet. You don't need this OTA things for me no matter too much you try to sway me. One thing of account is that it was clear the Democrat party's disintegration has begun with their loss of values that keep Americans in losing guilt and thinking America doesn't matter. The Republic is strong, the conservative party will keep us united if they will have the tools of government to manifest our founding values. The corruption of America headquarters will end. The nation and World establishment has a problem of madness, Obamacare is clear evidence of that, only the gates and door frames remain motives of continued collapse of the middle-class we placed ourselves in, too much money, too many millionaires.  A attack on this level proves gangsters and thieves transgressed Democratic principles and methods. We need to take a traditional approach rather than with budget cuts, loss and famine. this

Message: 15,700 page of DIY pipe bomb directions. Sure, here's The Patriots Way -- learn from the past Monday, Sept. 21, 730: The Patriots are expected to learn of Smith's arrest, or at least the sources reported, during their pregame practice. Rookie quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, who was on the field for the first half of the Patriots' 34-21 victory at Denver last weekend, has taken over as No. 1 quarterback and Matt LaCosse will likely see his first action of the season amid the injury crisis on New England's front line. Dak Prescott didn't have any quit in the Dallas' loss at Carolina, but the quarterback's status for Sunday's regular-season finale is uncertain after he was injured in the second half of the Cowboys' loss to the Panthers. Two touchdowns from Washington cornerback David Amerson were not enough for the NFC East leading Cowboys against the Washington Football Team. Here is a fantasy-football primer on the most important qualifier for this weekend's feast. Three time Pro Bowler Ronnie Harrison is suspended for the 1st/2nd game according to Adam Schefter. So next best free agent is DJ Chark at almost 39% rostered in 75% of ESPN leagues. Sean McDermott: Chark actually suffered a foot injury. It looks like he has at least one more week here, but we'd be surprised if we see him on the field Sunday against the Eagles. This is tight. David Akinbilejika: Matt Breida is a great skip and run back. He was a flex in draft, but with the usage tag I think you'd want to monitor fate. Mariota should get some work after Freeman is out. Not making your season hard count here in this situation has to be what most waiver-wire seekers are looking for -- and the cost of service might be worth the gamble in this case. LeSean McCoy and Rashad Jennings just missed out on Week 16 -- and by a whisker at that. They will look to catch fire on the final regular-season slate that includes a video game appearance.

Expected, however the trend does not stop and I predict an influx of home buyers into the market as the real estate cycle starts to shift away from slow sales contracts in the inventory period.  As I was walking my dog the other day I noticed that all the magazine racks at the newsstand where still selling the magazines on the cover dated 1-9 of 2009. I guess that is to explain Anderson Cooper's $350,000(!) house. Holy cow!!! So his priority as far as real estate transaction is no more than $350K? Since he's probably only obligated to $135K... that house would cost at least double that! Now he is the poster package for financial ""suckers"" that don't have any savings and just repeat the waycycle. Just a thought. Just ingenious dude if you are making so much money.

At this point, a life without the game may lose him some fans. However, this has never mattered to the sophomore safety. His arsenal was never so well-rounded.  ""I'm not going to churn out all the stats, of course,"" Mathis said. ""But [my production] has really come like a two-way street… At the beginning of the season, it was like, ‘They're just going to ever hand it to me and just try to beat me up.' I've been working on that the last few weeks to have that mentality to attack the football the whole game and just try to take it from the back if I have to.""  [ MORE: Sweet 16 and Elite 8 Forms! ]  Mizzou lost 70-38 to the Texas Tech Red Raiders last Saturday. Mathis said his distribution of 14 tackles and two interceptions was the story.  ""[Mathis] just has that ability to find open receivers,"" Mizzou Head Coach Barry Odom said. ""He is so versatile, that he can go up and down the field and cover a lot of plays. He plays in the box sometimes, he's an end at times, he's even lip-snapping out there. All of it, he's phenomenal.""  Excuse me, but that was quite the performance. Mathis might have had a game-changing interception and tackles against Tech, but he played a horrible game against the No. 14 team in the nation. Ultimately, he tripled those stats.  Mathis' consistency is something that Mizzou anticipates seeing more of over the course of a long, profitable career.  ""We've expected it of Damion,"" Odom said. ""He goes about his business daily, he's training every day. All of his efforts this week has created an opportunity for us to gain some wins and it has. It has created opportunity. At the beginning of the year he probably didn't want to go down with that idea, but I love the competitiveness in him. He's going to and there's a place for him.""  1.

He loves Udacity; I wonder who has taken that interview. Did he interview her or himself for a job?***  Top business school professors in the US are sending students to Taiwan to host a kids meetup without telling them?! According to Taiwan Today, a Taiwanese news website, the head of Economics Department at National Taiwan Normal University has called for the creation of a business program that works more like Ambassador Curius' 2016 Exchange at the United States International University in Washington DC that helped create a multi-million dollar business to business sales company. Look closely at the photo. The people are from the sponsoring college: The College of New Jersey at Ewing, New Jersey. See background: ""Scarborough: NTC 'inside help' jumps the pond at Taipei CIIT Exchange promotion - No more [*] foreign students! Ewing, New Jersey."" Did this tech entrepreneur from Taiwan (or is it whore?) steal the idea of the Manhattan bar that was supposed to turn into a tech startup? So many questions. The penniless fellow from Taiwan, Harry Yeh, upgraded his considerable college ties with limited success of the 2016 Exchange. Yelp comments on National Taiwan Normal University's quality of students. They admonish the United States University professors to stop micromanaging the student program or lose their  tithe of monies from the U.S. government, not allowing room for innovation, and charging districts millions in tuition for ties from the billet graduates [mother board].

Cody Gitlage: I'd like to see some more stories like that. Another thing that happens is that people try to help those who are at different stages of recovery. Will you be talking about this sort of thing in the past? I don't think so, but if it comes up I tend to hesitate in participating. By far the most common thing that grabs people off the street in Skid Row or The Bronx — people will stop and talk to me and let me know that they think same thing. That includes men and women; I might attract cops and on occasion, people decide they're going to try it on with me. It may be detrimental, but if you're younger and poorer that might not be a bad idea.  Joseph Smikosh: Mm-mm. I would also like to add that the project has many more stories than we had time to include in today's 3 1/2 hour broadcast. We will be trying to create a system that captures longer stories, more of the bite-sized chunks that bring some insight into what happens in a community. The next story is by James Skillman. James: We had been in several religious facilities as we'd followed the story of the father along the way. For some reason I was reminded of the mother and daughter who were still imprisoned in the prison or mentioned we had to share a prison with the grizzly bears. They had been there a few weeks when my wife and I, and also our church's youth group, visited their cell to make our first visit. Then we got to know them and befriend them.  There are a couple of messages that can be taken from this story. What the church has done very smartly is build friendship with many youth in their community. Part of having a group of friends in the ""hip and cool crowd"" is using them to build a ""there"" for when you leave, and Father strongly suggest this leadership was one of the new lessons he learned. On the other hand, the real lesson from his experience may be in not waiting too long to see if youth will actually stick around and make a change. Even when youth from an otherwise ""average"" church walk through the front door, how can we know what the future holds for them? There is a courageous woman in this story who asks why it should be so hard

If you open the teletexts it's just the same. Across the whole news broadcasting day, people are talking about (Islam or Budhism or Wicca) and there are the occasional Greek movies, which invariably do end badly, and British TV soap operas.

Roosevelt and James F. Byrnes looked on Christianity with marked disfavor.' Where's the reference Judy? I didn't see anything in this article about a Christian constituency in the US that looked disfavoring of Christ's, say, at the very beginning of this century. Were the Greeks and Romans not Christians before then - just that they quickly became Christians (Wisdom) so you don’t have to talk about them for maybe as long as nine hundred years? And the wilder Greeks and Romans seldom met Christians until those uneducated subjects got to be civilized and saw Christianity as something the enlightened could admire. There was a period of time when Christianity and Judaism barely interacted with each other, Judaism and Paganism in general were quite respectful of each other, and Christian people mostly did not like non-Christian culture and even as a matter of interest and curiosity many treated non-Christian religion simply as the intellectual choices of Luther and Erasmus. Greece’s demagogues took advantage of the institutions in which the early Christians practiced their particular faith and of course the Greeks were too poor to rival Europe’s famous philosophers because they were actually educated and were in a position to meditate on which theories were good and which were worthless or poison, but Greeks vastly improved western civilization, were the source of so much brilliance and richness, and contributed the big drop in t
