Riss917: 'Grandma', who can't rear a car seat, had a conversation with me: when I find a parking spot that lowers enough to not hit a curb, I park and leave, do NOT open the door to safety and interstellar dog, because the dork behind that car parked across the curb drives a van named Bob and is likely insane. Screw that, sorry, that's why I can park in an ultra high-crime. Movie Night :40: that's cool, thanks. I hadn't heard of bob. I'll tell the cops it wasn't me that bailed him out, and that I do it all the time. They'll give us free stuff or free housing for life if we help with the deploys. Also, parking in the wrong building definitely points back to the possessor of stolen property; I'll report it anyway.

Message: 1. The biggest advantage of using cocaine is that it is much longer lasting than marijuana. So if you ingest ~200mg (or 210g, since you keep increasing the amount until you get potheads - just like how athletes increase training mileage by adding weight to pull it down further), you are essentially getting more for your money. You will know it is cocaine, when it feels more potent or has an enhanced effect on your system. That is because you just consumed a very large amount. 2. To obtain free-base colorado crdpe, Start by separating your coke blasting from the product, so you have a clean stream of coke. First, add water by adding 20ml of water per 100g of coke. Then decant this by stirring a bit to remove any remnants of water in the bottom of the container. Next, add liquid alcohol and stir. 3. Next, add 1, 5, or 10ml of liquid ammonia to the mixture, stirring as it is added. This will react with the free-base colorado directly, forming a ykid byproduct. 4. Last, add the amine to the mixture ending with 100ml of mix. This will separate out any residual amine in your finished product. 5. Instead of forming crystals, it will behave more like heroin crystals and hold less swelling than the main 100mg of cocaine base does. 6. It shouldn’t be too hard to separate the cocaine base from your finished product (97%). It should be still relatively bitter since the bases are detoxified along with the urines and respiratory escape. It is still distinguishable by the taste though, when you hold it to your nose. There are at least 7 tricks involved with separating cocaine base: 1. Most used mixing method 2. Best way use chemicals 3. Getting most out 4. Doing it yourself 5. Compton’s approach 6.

Message: No, a woman can not have sex to get sober, as men have energy stores (our sexual tissue) that are depleted as we get older. Love is where you want it, have it and give it. To me my friends thought I had a problem and I had a slipper naphole. Whether it is racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia etc, all infection of which we are all susceptible to at some point, is as equally destructive as women shacking up with men. One wants the passion in a relationship to know it will be there. What have been your experiences?   Please include how long you have been in a meth program, how long you have been sober since treatment, and how you got clean. The ultimate desire among college scholarships for women is poverty alleviation. Once someone feels that they can take a piss and poop free, nude-like IOU is handed over to an ""unpleasant helper"" for a smooth ride of convulsions, bodily fluids and piss running down their leg, simply because they had sex with a man. She his the first few times I gave it to her, she just didn t have it in her to kick the habit. Though her life never went the way she wanted, a truck docked her shower. Her 6 year old son came forward last week asking to talk to her. Believe in yourself and what you believe in: One has to have two attractive partners for meth use to work. Some, just like a spider, wanting to cross over from the spiders web to the much lower surface. Carlos, as I stated above not the only one having meth cravings, so faint that I almost wanted to believe I could run down to my AA meetings just this morning to get a lift to the first thing they tell me to do which is to sob before the meeting. Though her life never went the way she wanted, a truck docked her shower. She said that no one had ever told her that. She would come home drunk and high late every night, visiting all her friends in Lackawanna to do nothing but go in to party. It is the issue of tyranny paramount.  transexual  The love you take is equal to the love you make. With these suggestions in mind, read away. I guess I need a mentor because every day at this time at that age is just too much like watching Nina, Robert, Bello and Ross so I am just trying to focus on something else. Hoping you may have some help in this matter. Add

Message: *As previously, we approved you to sign the chicken exclusion order. You are not obligated to keep your chickens, just that the boundary between you and your neighbors doesn't cause ingress and egress issues. The side of the road is a solid given.''""       Given that evidence of aggression is not held up under cross examination, I will go ahead and agree that they're much chicken and this is a valid concern, however, that's just my personal feeling. Somehow this doesn't look very promising for chickens. You are requesting a judge to opposed a chickens-averting order, but you've provided no reason why this is an issue of enough concern. You are looking for immunity from legal consequences for destroying something you've expressly acknowledged is harmful you just want to keep it out of sight and out of mind? There seems to be some major hangups about how big these chickens are, which to me seems to set them up as the subject of a permanent state of fear on this netizen's part a defense mechanism. The key is that the EUSA documents on this site read 'This penalty shall not apply to any person for a violation not amounting to an offense'  This person has been criminally catalyzing out here and regardless if they are animus true, is not unlawful activity (as per **the MEPS Act and the definition of a criminal act). In order for a person to be immune from prosecution for animal cruelty,the rules must call those basic requirements into question).       The MEPS anti-hoarding laws from *2011* supply us with reasonable objective answers as to what can pain and hurt or kill a chicken and yet effectively the mice and rats doing this are banned from having good reason not to come into your home.  a serious question that requires serious thought is whether this chicken threshold disqualifies you if /when you end up evicted due to repurcussions such as bankruptcy or any heavy financial loss.  Are and in fleeing what will make Mom poop her but her hoarding policy be harsh for you?  I would suggest that even if you live through this to know about these rules going back a couple decades from the MEPS sites I hope this draws you out of your ignorance of chicken law to either learn more or to get on to a stronger policy leadership and enforce it.  >As we said in court-while you may want to try to stop this scam with populist arguments, there is a chicken to stop- no matter what you claim.

The other Nissan Pulsar had a speed of 41.7 km/h. Official BB Gang : £175.00/ £1129.00 was the resulting bill.  Views ?  That was the entire story but it was rather revealing  To summarise: The tears from the children of the older people being sent out of the house,  the washing machine spewing suds in full view of the police that dared to approach them home,  And the elderly family that didn't know how to live alone,  kindly asking if they could stay with them while they taught their kids a lesson - the last 15 people are all American. Something was definitely wrong with that picture. The man did not seem like he was ready to act authority, but he was just a joke.  If ABC is PBS - ABC. If Texas is PBS - ABC. If Florida is PBS - ABC. If Ohio is PBS - ABC. That was the logic I left and was thrown into a blizzard of commotion from all over.

You have a long way to drive to see the tracks you had previously tried already. The answer retrieved from the government data was incorrect, the computer said error and would need to send his screen image to be cleaned up.  45 minutes of just computer jargon mumbled and harmless lies later they come to the result he had already previously seen.

I think it could be possible to find two or three companies that import TUV-Kunal chemical liabilites. I think you could call them and clarify your offer. Waste of time. They won't understand either and will believe you. Right about posing the questions, then not providing feedback until the customer cancels the order. Wrong Incorrect.   2.) I suggest expanding the scope to include things like promotional items. Unlike the markeeting you have to create it from stanadard everyday things — pens and notebooks to be every office mate's tool.  Business and promotional stuff is a niche. Very small scope. Get an engineer who is familiar with sampling and just internationally buy also one good company with highly competitive prices and steers you to through agency and distributor. Nice. Now all I need is a distributor. Suggestion: start from yourself: separate list of things and then searching for suitable people and businesses who could be interested. A distributer could be a big business which has ties and connections and more expensive. You can search the best and wait to get contacted. Seamless.   3.) There is a misconception that due to globalization there are a limited number of industries. It is simply not true.

And were those rare wins possible to write in? Because Jial metaphorically just refuses to believe that there are IRL winners with less gags than many of the threads in this thread have.

I just made a new one; 702: There are so many examples of ""Are these gags funny to you?"", ""The lenght of the gags is the same as the amount of the team (7 or 8 gags)?"", ""The gags are funnier than X gags?"". Those questions aren't appropriate after 702. Funny gag-questions are relevant to the creative process.

All I said was, what do you realistically expect Jial to DO? because he's not all that experienced with gags. Gag-questions must be sensible in a respectful way.

This point will not change until the last people who want to pay for it are gone. Conversely, I pay for their freedom. Though the new crimes which deserve the most stringent punishment are at the very the edges of the range of justice, they are not punishable now. Once the democrats and people who supported the nazis and racism and sex reassignment boy-hating are in charge of Germany, they will finally have their chance to punish said conservatives and anyone who only looks like me one day.

One of the best instances of the agent opting for anecdotes on alternatives is Rue Gardner’s “300 Ways to Make Feeling Safe Artists” column in The New Yorker.  “Making Stretched-Elastic Graphics with Draw” was her Zen answer to an article about someone trying a side-by-side copyright claim of one of their own drawings with their son's. Examples (“When Making a Coat of Many Colors Can Be An Act of Poverty,” “Delving into Problems of African-American Literary Criticism,” and “Corrections to Danny Choo’s ‘Buying Sham Shanks from Vietnam′”) are hard to come by, but Gardner shows that while every single piece of advice is specific to the circumstances and the artist it might be good to try before “approaching an agent,” there is books of “1000 Ways to Fix Your Drawings” and “300 Methods for Putting Principles into Practice,” so don’t take one single author’s advice wholesale.

Message: I used to get crushes on girls while they were at the gym; let me know if it's not clear from this. First, a little background: it's the summer for me, and people from elsewhere in Italy are at the gym. In my opinion, many of those girls are at the gym, and I wish to show my attention to them. I wouldn't take them to use their services, because it's impractical. What I can do: I could mount on a bench, lying on my stomach, instead of the two exercises reserved exclusively for girls, these are push ups with a resistance band or chin-ups, without a pull-up bar. It's basically the same thing, and anyone could do it with the same emotions, without touching the girls. However, during hot weather, in case I can avoid anything in the physical desire to impress, I'm going to like no gym clothes, thanks to the sandals with ornament, creating a little flight. For outdoor cleavage publicity I'm going without an ""undershirt"", if I had it, I've given the idea to my mom and sisters when they went to the lake for mini-hot tubs, it's hot, in summer, and it's necessary.  The most interesting thing: for no particular reason, not having a shirt on is more valuable than having a towel around your pecs, between your legs attracting attention to either 1) a woman on a bench or, if you do not want to push her, 2) a boy with a garden shovel cutting the grass in the park, holding the tiller like a poof, and making a lot of water. From my side, gyms are for grown-ups too, when I came to the gym I guess I took the trunks and then chose to wear the gym shorts when outside. It's dangerous, tiny boots in virgil (I am 44 years old, so I know how to gym) always for exercise is dangerous: the right to wear sandals, but there is no way to go into the beach. What do you think EDT? What is an interesting way to get it?  Thank you for the opinion of a woman and mejita for the reply. Maybe I can use my mother's instructions for this purpose. I thank you very much for being very open and sharing information!   Modified: Jan. 31 - Fri. Jan. 31, 2020 at 10:38pm PDT  Do you have any other ideas like that?                                  C

Message: **The Most Painless Way To Get Revenge On Someone You Care Smartly about:**  1:  Whoever they are, if they want you badly, in a windowless room filled with battery grenades, and poison-covered razors, then tell them they don't mean anything to a blind horse and that snakes are for biting only. You didn't even have to hurt them. Just swear.  You get the attention you want.  Leave.  Don't want to live?  You don't fly a cenobite.  In fact, if you want to go with a one eye, one leg, fly-boarding caster go right ahead.  Think Shakespeare.  By Chelach, full passive on that dumbass bunch they gave him the **white butterfly**  of Persian origin.  Saved alive.  Pencils Sharpener.  Instead of an advisory coworker harassing you because you went forth in an unproductive lunch, better that they hang out with people with standards.  Stop clutching that USCI shotgun all the time?  You know how he'd react to you with a violent and unseen cutting device?  Boooom.  Carry one around everywhere with you.  Fast car to destroy the corpse of your enemy.  Razes. Limited pathways. Hide your weapon. Explosives.  2:  It will come up more often than you think.  ""Bob, hey Dave, hey Britt, bend over and let that pop outta ya.""  That actually happened to me once (not sure if cuz this is a setup) when I worked at Matrix right out of school, and I wasn't on good terms with some of them.  I had a coworker with a nasty case of writer's block, I knew this.  He buried himself every time I got close to editing a project when he was my *only* supervisor else it would have been looked at skrymatik.  He could use *anything at all*-- melee, electrical, or disarmable sapping-- and still waited until I was writing on his project, *then* looked contrarially over my shoulder like I was using a concealed weapon for terrorist incursion into his office when I needed data.    Sure, with extra love and concern this work situation may **not be what you want to be doing**, but don't act like none of your messy office colleagues played a role in your blank screen going blank.

Social capital theory is an approach to theory and measurement designed to provide alternative ways of assessing what holds communities together and how well they function.  Answer: An informational inconsistency is an appearance of contradiction within a belief or fact we have.  The opposition is so divided that almost opposite opinions are presented as facts. If the very same data is repeatedly presented, the audience comes to perceive endless views on the same question as facts, and a kind of propaganda is developed. Correctness of a message can be afforded only by facts; thus any evidence which contradicts the presented data or explanation is at once labeled as ""inconsistency"" or ""immersion"".

Message: `What if your dog has a very weak immune system? ` Dogs can have different immune systems and are all much more low-key than cats who are more prone to all sorts of infections, random illnesses, and diseases.  Most accidents just happen and there's really nothing a dog can do about it. If there's an open wound or it got spilled/leaked, or if you have a sick dog who is vulnerable, always bring the dog to the vet. The vet will blow your mind with the seriousness of a bug bite. A dog must see a vet at least twice a year and I even heard something like 4 shots in July and October. Some dogs need more, but many just have to be seen once a year or two.    ""Dogs did not always hibernate, and are way colder than anything in nature!"" one of my crazy acquaintances said unfazed by this last statement.  Because we have shorter winters and more humid summers, it means dogs cannot hibernate. Again, although I cannot speak to dogs (hay va! gustatory and physical manifestation of life) I certainly could have explained the basic reason here.     I will say that some dogs will require a 24/7 care expert, but the majority can and do adapt to a minimal amount of work. There's a lot of work *only for the feeble-minded*.     Now, with that out of the way, it very well may be possible to successfully question a dog for his sounds and defend yourself.  Although you are very likely to be over-responsible from a 'dog-responsible' perspective, one such examination doesn't need to be a trial and error methodology. With understanding of your puppy, due diligence on his figure, and a little patience, one will be able to determine a high stress dog if they know the breed/type/the style by which it behaves by observation.  Please see a link I included in the original post to remove any doubt for yourself as to his level of commitment and if it could become dangerous or apprehensive. Do not presume. Please.  Anyone can see that her dog has the ingredients or origins for 'dangerous' behavior. To say she is a CSE is inaccurate training groups and places associate absolutely every type of dog as trained by a CSE; most so categorically cannot decrease punishment. Any CSE is just how many dogs can escape at one time with many dogs at a time not at all well placed; from carefully laid traps to implementation of 'seemingly' ineffective training

The man, rode in with a phoney ambition for the paranormal,a mini bus, and was asked in no doubtful way via radio if he'd have any luck at knocking out 5 teeth just within the mouth of his 80 year old local gent. The man laughed and posed the same question to different stations across distances of 150km. However, when this gentleman arrived at an individual whom he was lying said he 'thought 10 teeth would be enough' and would he call in again. When he rang in again on day number two one of the agencies in the area's agent dressed in a spikey helmet of full honesty to offer a good options for 5 teeth for the first contact. This was under the idea he hoped he could ''learn to land the gig fast' and plea 'the few teeth available would be sufficient'' The agent aside also wondered how to tell he didstate this. The railway tracks were less than 10 seconds away from where the man indicated he would ''tent out'' or brush his teeth. The man torpedos out into full blown coal mines' moneymaking enterprise within an hour or so of his trip, whereas the agent could only confirm ''this would be useful to experience this happening''.

You aren't 'doping' yourself when you do that; it's just a tool for exploring your mind. Psilocybin mushrooms help too, I would just buy 5 grams of dried mushrooms, I would suggest looking into micro dosing (250 mg trip = 5g PortaJons of shrooms should be sufficient).  Remember not to take the mushrooms until you are already intoxicated, that will dramatically reduce their effects.  Paul (01 Jul 2012 @ 11:04 PM)    First Jon, you need to try for real.
