Here they are! All of them. Website-spanning-time capsules of ""Can you smell what ECCO was cooking?"" type of deals. Awesome. You can create your own log-in, god-forbid, of course, to download your free ""digital file organization software"". You've got to create a SEPARATE name and password and login for EACH of the various branches of government and local governments and local school boards.

For FPPs that's pretty automatic since the nature of the site dictates that most readers will never see them again. Metafilter discussion, more often than in other environments, is not in that same context. Comments, though, in which someone could potentially cast a long shadow over your argument history or conversations with future employers, should more leading questions be asked again later, require additional examination.  One of the strengths of web forums in general is the time lag that gives poster a chance to rethink something, edit, or beep the thread before hitting submit. I really miss that from pre-Metafilter social media, but there is a safety net of anonymity that keeps us all much more honest than we have ever been in person. So, yes, non-anonymous honesty is better than anonymous presumptions, but even extending that to this thread's conversation, I'm still not sure that would have produced high quality answers I'd want to recommend people both follow and save in a Galactica Hub. posted by BrianJ at 1:03 PM on December 30, 2010 [1 favorite]  Ultimately, I don't know that there's a ton of point in using these as hubs for valid, useful, substantive answers to questions.

Message: 9000 people telling you their best idea'   There is a massive elephant in the room of all this that everyone is forgetting. People post on reddit all the time because they don't have anyone else in real life to talk to. That's why they bother going online and giving personal stories or life experiences to people who they'll never know personally.   Reddit celebrates this to an extent. 'Oh, it's OK that you believe something like this people on the internet would too'  There is one fundamental difference between Reddit and talking to people in the real world. Ladies and gentlemen, it's anonymity. Everyone in real life has consequences if they say something that they don't believe in. Although the internet breeds maybe a little bit more honesty in some areas, there is certainly a lot of morons who just throw inaccurate information out there as they know they don't have to deal with the repercussions if someone ignores them or criticises them for it. That's why I've written this long post, admitting myself to be a total moron, because I don't have to fear being held accountable for such accusations.   Some of you may be thinking 'Oh get out of here. Jeez. You must not have long in real life to come up with such a ridiculous point.' Well, yeah sure, I've only got to the age where everything that you believe and think about the world is evidently false, because you barely understand how it works. So you grow up and realise you've been a moron.   That aside, what about recommendations and trying to make a hopeful difference to the world. People like to read up on their news and current events online because it's to their fingertips and easier than going out and talking about it with people in the real world. Well, let's be honest. Reddit and the way it's setup breeds ignorance towards things like posting and popular belief towards One's stances and beliefs. The way the site is setup is an utter failure in that sense. News providers, to geographical regions, to subreddits sprouting up for similar belief think-tanks regarding opinion and world events. Holding these little belief groups up to where the casual user can find them easily. Which creates a large silent majority of opinions and beliefs which I would have to imagine is like a self reinforcing cycle of depression and distrust of authorities and information provided to us by people care less and less about the destruction they live in that is driven by the insanely wealthy people fuelled by the excessive consumption of the mass markets and the targeted advertisement.

What I have to say is that these are not the only types of unskilled new riders that venture into Santa Monica, only that IMO its the most embarrassing and because of this an anemic cowardly style that somehow makes skaters look bad.   Is obiously not the intent of the police to ""starve"" skaters for this although there may be an element that would approve of such a manner of preferential punishment if forced to concede it .   They pass the impressions back on in their own manner, and the city looks at their spend and uses the perception as an instrument of policy. # posted by  : at 3:12 PM [ revised 11:02 PM EST ]3/05/2006   My suspicions of the reasons why the Santa Monica Police have been assigned to harass and intimidate skateboarders in Santa Monica have now been confirmed by a senior Police official. When I submitted a Freedom of Information Request to Chief Taylor of the Santa Monica Police,(whose focus on skate bashing was then and remains a heel dragging antequated lame attempt to be cool with the local old money, rather than doing what he is paid to do--to enforce resolution, with merit and efficacy his DA's office cannot do, and for our town the police cannot do enough-hire.  These documents link Chief Taylor and Assistant Division Chief Adam Phillips to involvement and active participation in the September 2001 Skateboarding Retreat at Sturges California, a stated objective of which was to strategize ways to   ""medicate the problem of skateboarders to the point past which dilatory governmental practice is intolerable.""   Not having assessed via text interactions, the textampaign list period  August 2002 to September 2003, I would say that this above mentioned  policy retreat had concrete results  which may have included, as would be expected extensive lobbying of the Santa Monica City Council through the office of Assistant or Deputy City Managers who had drafted the policy to supress skateboarding in their September 1 997 memo., as is evident from the Jan 4 2001 non-response memo to the March16 2000 memorandum.

Message: 30 inches of cattle prod and 3,000 volts. It's also safe to assume that he knew that the cattle prod would make an audible ‘clicking’ noise when it was charged. For these reasons, I will say that, if he was told explicitly that there was such a device, Scientology could be found guilty of murder and probably convicted. >  > If he did not tell anyone that there would be such an device, or if he was told to carry it in his pocket, it may be difficult for Scientologists to prove their innocence, because the student would use more specificity in his/her statements, thereby testifying to specific action rather than conjecture. >  > Fallon is quick to point out that not just any pain-in-the-ass body protection is sufficient to increase by 40-fold a person’s odds of survival in this situation and that the student must pick, tactically, a very specific kind of ass-specific protection. “If I’m worried about getting a toilet plunger stuck up my ass,” is how Fallon puts it, “I don’t have to just yank out one of those from the cupboard when the Lawyers for a Non-Penal Scientology come at me with a golf club. I want one of those super-duper one-handed plungers that extend to, like, 2 feet long while you’re using it and come with a retractable handle.” Fallon skillfully draws the distinction between a torture and a penetration scenario with (finally) a high school physics lecture. “When someone’s plugged the toilet, all Feng can do is flail around with his plunger. But when his ass is plugged with a golf club, he’ll only very occasionally run into the legs of the person holding the stick, yes?” Fallon asked. >  > There is some real interesting, useful information in this psych eval—at least to Scientologists. Fallon revealed, “In a golf club-solitary confinement scenario, the best protection is a cattle prod, according to Ms. Feng’s findings. They are more effective than iPhones or Japanese tourist water in jumping jacks.” Now, Scientology may need about as much of a leg up as they can get. “But of course,” says Skeptics' representative Steve Massett, “at $59.95, the cattle prod is a tad more expensive than the water in Japanese tourist jumps. And if he bought the [straight] aviation model probe—which runs $99—the value lost crashed even lower. No great value in having a probe that doesn’t taze,

Message: what not to do.""  Zolleranimator: attempted a beer they would know. ""I tried drinking some"" we'd know something was up since we'd try to talk them out of it even had people who would take 1 drink and run to the bathroom.  AWK501: A pity, then, that it is possible to roofie someone surreptitiously. IIRC if you have a can hidden away in a plastic-encased pouch hidden in your pocket, you are less likely to have it detected by Airport Authorities, presumably because the metal detector would only see metal and not worry about the can. enchantomox: Most detectors can still pick up the aerosol vapour. I'd assume if anyone tried this way, they'd be after you the second you got on the plane. AWK501: Those aerosol things are easily detected. You would have to have an empty can with to put in the pouch. Then fill it at the hotel. I am more concerned with in-flight drinks, or even on the ground stuff. enchantomox: Whaaaaat?  I'm not sure what you're talking about with people fine the spray. Obviously NTA not that I think it matters but they can't detect what is in the can. AWK501: I would not be surprised if they can. Other readers are correct at how easy it is to tell whether a beer has been opened, thus you would not be surprised if you were asked to open it. Consider this AskReddit. As I read their advice, it seems the TSA is not worried with what is in the cans, but simply cans in canisters. The main concern is the drink, its source, and the liquid wrapped up in the sandwich. High flight risk! I wonder if French fries or other carbohydrate snacks are safe. enchantomox: That does concern me as I have several lengthy flights coming up for work!  With regards to the container thing, a sealed box of beer is fine, the liquid ones though you can tell if they've been opened so I understand that's the difference there.  AWK501: I'm pretty sure the detectors can tell sniff and meat as it's called. I tried the Narrangansett Creamsicle which is really bad and the TSA guy said it was okay. He dumped it, although I am sure the directions said to pour the liquid out. enchantomox: Yup I'd agree on the sniffer.

Message: 21099 as requested I need help figuring out the wording on the note. Her response: ""Thanks but fear not blackmail is one of my specialties.""  This is the same person that was dating another coworker a month ago. The extra info is important for understanding the degree of making a mistake in dealing with her. The second thing (dumping a long-term GF of 4 years in four words 'we just lost our spark') is a requirement. And the final and straw that broke the camel's back: the living at home/without a car shown in her Facebook photos (and since been personally confirmed via a coworker). Some may think it was a nice thing for her to save me my 2454 miles (rounded up from 2400ish at $1/per) mileage for my interview. I do not think so. This all paints a very frail woman who shows obvious immaturity and I thought her asking for shopping money was some joke of mine got out of control. Nope. She was serious.   Everything about her situation, her being and her tactics shows an age between 16-22. I have a feeling this won't end well for her but I'd like to offer the best case scenario and assume it isn't a forgery or lies.  So please, enlighten me WIFEFLAIR on my situation. I also think this needs to be reported to the HR department since I did not directly talk to the interviewer but rather through her.      ---      **tl;dr**: Interviewed in San Diego after dropping everything to be there. Meanwhile someone transfer to San Diego 'fingered' a guy at his work for harassment when she wanted to eliminate his competition. So turnabout is fair play. I refused and now HR must be informed.

Message: 1 Fanwick Street, Swamp Booger  The questions would help expose unintentional bias in AI written by humans, they said. For example, a pattern recognition AI such as IBM Watson might overcome its biases if it learned a first (scripted) response, such as ""Chris Evans was not born in Swamp Booger, Canada, as he is *Swedish*, you imbecile. The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell."" The formulated response would clearly be biased against the script writer and should override the AI's baseline bias against Swamp Booger. The authors' argument was that if the bias can be artificially scripted out, without making it obvious to the person providing the original bias, we can find the bias and get rid of it, thus removing the racism/sexism/disability from the AI. Unfortunately, their research as presented on July 18th 2017 had some technical vulnerabities, and instead of recognizing the bias they reported that they had eliminated it. Just look at the hindsight bias!  This is worrying new research [wired.com], reminding me of how rude I was to Gus Bailor when I first joined the lounge.  who even does that?

Message: 2 weeks worth of pranks I thought of.  Lol what a dick.  Well you aren't doing anything wrong by using a name definition site to help you determine gender, common name (James for instance) that is also common with people of both genders.  I've used it to find out too if a name is common are not and which gender, if given both a male and female example. But for a name to be so common with one gender of another that people tend to just assume gender it seems like a gender bias article that must be based on some survey data. They must have asked 'if you were going to name a child would you name XYZ'.  I guess it is somewhere accurate, it could be suggestive how often the individual gender's are used he's definitely finding both sexes.  It would be great if lather would return, I'd use a 5 blade next generation from Gillette again I do think their 3 blade cartridge are a bit aggressive.  Fuchsia is interesting I have never heard of this family is there any synsepalum monotipic species' or disease resistant ones? They seem more ornamental.  I think it baffles me Cell Gifts do fairly large shipments, as in very large shipments and don't fix their caused, from the stories I've heard in real life too. Yup they commercialize these online sources because people donate way too often. & I have no idea why. I've even seen them omit centerpieces for whole tiers! Of funeral flowers that are meant to be shared as a group (for relatives).  Even wholesale from international sites is my guess. Or somehow buying affordable options in a bundle, that are meant for the last box of their staple variety, often get sold through as people donate seemingly endless flowers they think no one will want at their local church. Which is often a random shy middle aged woman getting them for strangers graves, happen to visit that area.  This is my guess of how they sometimes send out such large or odd arrangements. So either by buying them directly at wholesale from different places/ countries that get quite a variation or buying it in bulk.  Or perhaps get customs to bring so much in that would cause mass deportation, for not correctly labeling the value. & it gets sold at a funeral center.  This is just my guess... Because I saw it happen a few years ago.  I had no idea so many people owned so many edible plants they are excited to be outdoor.  I've never seen any 'swingers' or cuckhold videos.

The album remained at #1 for weeks and received like tons of Grammy nominations with the honor of winning a 1984 Grammy for “Best Contemporary Christmas Album.” The album was rated at #50 on the All-Time Billboard 200 list.

Yes, it's every where in the interent: You DON'T want to have 4 1ghz as a general purpose solution. Nope, it will not fly (so to speak).  Instead just combine them.  Have you watched the previously posted video by AMD on the true hyper-threading feature, and how the P-4 just merged sp groups to one core? Well here's the other side - a lot more believable and serious. What Intel could have learned from the Barton processors, P4s without NX etc right from the get-go, that extra cache line insertion that goes undetected, and so on - they could have made a 3.4/3.6ghz 32bit chips since the 3.26 without you even noticing - it's interesting to think about it.  As always with performance per MHz, Travis ""Trav"" W (aka Mystify, or the OLC blackbox/tcl god) suggested that AMD should have gone with the idea to strike at the core nuclear power by increasing instruction throughput and increase L1 and L2 cache (100-150% thruput and a 100-200% cache increase).  Today, or not too long ago, the Athlon64 FXslington 80+inner is one of the fastest computers in the world. They also make less heat and are more energy conservative that P3s and P4s of the same frequency, so they're cheaper also, all other things equal.  -Rick  Corrected video name - cheers.

Random chance has part to do with the mercy of cooperation, but unstinting greed is the tendency of, well, lawyers of course.  You seem to think we are some exception.  But thats why restitution has to be clarified- and examples of poor conduct puts the emphasis on individual, and not corporate duty.  There is a a comprehensive international code of conduct, this is not it.  My U.C.C reference was specific to just New York, but again, this is a broad, and comprehensive, solution that is applicable to worldwide and involves a transition from man's logic to man-made logic.  The legal reasoning process itself is flawed, it go from assumption original idea, without inspection, to law.  If something wasn't there when this analytical process began, it is a problem with the process itself.  Using logic can be useful in predicting areas of opportunity, but cannot to determine the actual nature of the opportunity, even a little.  Only systems with true interaction from feedback can infer and communicate the right answer, through logic within logic, symbolic reasoning.  It is unjust for you, as it is unjust for everybody, to determine the value of something before hand, as a mere person, thinking you know better than the values of exchange intrinsic to real systems.  We ask ourselves, what is the value of our time, what is our life again worth?, and then we look at our mortgage bills and effort required to meet the expense.  Then, we go to work, and the responses you get amount to hate or apathy.  People change their minds overnight because the mind has a capacity to manipulate itself beyond your reason.  Time is money, for some more than others.  There is no just way to speak to people without justifying their positions.  We live in the Economy, and when we speak of desire, we speak to an irrational, indecisive power.  We fell a little thrill at this, being able to indulge and not die as a result.  But the statement is only relevant in Faction.  I cannot speak about the American system because I am not involved in it, only hear from the popular opinion about it, in its current state.

Larry: 'How can we put an end to male chauvinism?' One man had a different take on the entire discussion. He likened it to chugging five ice teas or seven martinis, or the amount of mushrooms one has eaten. He would not elaborate on the last part.  Jay: 'What fact about your name really gets on your nerves?' Ryan Seacrest's voice wasn't working, so the honor went to John Leguizamo, and his masterful impersonation.  Jay: 'What threats does America face in the coming decade?' Rich Eisen's voice was being monitored at the monitoring board. They can slow or speed up his voice at their leisure. It reminded us of our early sci-fi books. You could speed up a tape and make it sound like an alien.  Larry: 'Who should have access to the internet?'

Zack goes over editing and some of the gear you will need to do it yourself. Have you attempted any self-portraits recently? Come on, we know you’ve got some snapshots on your cell phone. How do I attempt a self-portrait Zack? Zack really breaks down a self-portrait and we even with some light wedding photography tips sprinkled in. Give his video a watch as you will learn something from it.  2018 brought change for both going out and coming in.

It’s the question most common we at Kessler hear in the photo and video world, and it’s also the hardest to answer.

Camera obliteration, if you will. Not in the 50 year extreme TLC hardware technique see in so many old films, but technologically speaking. From the developing and redeveloping of dyes to new wheel-tension methods, to having drills embedded in cameras, nothing is untouched.

Yes! You now have a choice — Congress passed, and President Donald Trump signed, legislation making May 6 a “National Day of Prayer for Unborn Children.” This day, in addition to its purpose as a day of rest and meditation on the value of human life and the blessings we have been given, honors those who choose life for their unborn children.  The National Day of Prayer is a day designated by the United States Congress for the people of the United States to turn to God in prayer and meditation. It is observed on the first Thursday of May.

Would also hate to be one of the lawyers, arguing that a spouse was really not committing adultery if they got caught.  Quote from: Lando Lincoln on April 19, 2018, 03:54:11 PM  Would also hate to be one of the lawyers, arguing that a spouse was really not committing adultery if they got caught.  It would be very hard for lawyers to make good arguments if the CPUs bugged attorneys offices and attended law school classes and court proceedings. Something that such an AI would be able to do, even if the CPU couldn't imitate a human mind or know enough human laws by that time.It would only get exponentially more difficult to argue convincing arguments that don't exist if the CPU can imaginatively review incidents and arguments from the internet.Encyclopedia Galactica  There are ways to passively monitor just about anything the CPU will do, including recording, but refrain from analyzing audio for some time periods.  I'm not sure how good text programs would be, but would need to be doing their best to write what seems appropriate before AI millennial workers start looking for these programs. Just imagine the press a tradable AI stock could garner.  There might be a tradeoff where the CPU's latency increases and decreases for  1) observing the universe  2) interacting with the universe  3) oh, thinking isn't required any more  3a) hallucinating is a lot less important too  3b) or even avoid it like our society is doing with dreams (some people suggesting that good dream experiences can make them feel better)  3c) telepathy via devices might be possible depending on how sensitive the quantum protocols are  3d) telekinese might be possible via devices  Encyclopedia Galactica  I guess there's no big worry about being arrested and having no lawyer because no lawyers exist. I think our era is a drop in the bucket.  If lawyers continue to exist, they will be talking to the CPUs.  The 24-hour news cycle is not something that is keeping either emergence or despotism from slowing down. Emergence is not something that can be slowed down per se, but the AI superintelligence will respond to the thought that technology is not causing despotism. Technological advancement and despotism is not the same phenomenon.Encyclopedia Galactica  ""default flowgam

Shuffle Shuffle Shuffle. Let me get this straight. If I get it wrong you're going to email CNN and tattle on me. If I get it right you think CNN will (A) get scared shitless and stop covering you or (B) six months from now print what you've told me. Yep: an aide to a Congressman who thinks Fox News is a credible source of information actually emailed CNN to put pressure on them for exposing a scandal in which the Congressman is heavily involved. Let me tell you something: every day for three and a half years Fox News has told me that, should I ever betray one of their stories, they will out me...instantly. They have made it a point to make themselves worthy of my trust, told me, promised me they will not keep secrets. They have held up their end of the deal. I do the same. That said...when someone gives me a story, I am not your fucking bag man. It's not my job to do your bidding. It's my job to get justice.  I try to get admitted to these damn White House parties, ok?

VirginiaTeleborro: It's not the size of the income that counts, rather, it's what you do with it.  OP: Ok.  Again, Orpheum.  737 people capacity.  Was definitely not ""sold out"".  VirginiaTeleborro: Recently went to a seven dance showcase at SFU on Sunday. Instead of getting students tickets, we decided to pay adult price so we get adults seats.  What I wonder about is that the students tickets would have cost less than Wed-AC, and we could sit in the gallery-like area (not in the seats) and I can understand if they want to allow kids to have more informed taste of music (they have a tougher time paying for a concert for the after all), but they would still be selling them at 5 dollars per student. I mean, I get the bad cost-benefit thing there right, but it would theoretically mean that the whole hall must be at least 1,135 people capacity at the very least.  I am sure there is hidden admission cost for businesses to get paid back, I am also sure that the ""free"" stuff I do get are more than hidden admission cost. For the record I do go to concerts, the money is just so darn tight right when the tickets come out and I still owe rent.  So in general I am not surprised that this kinda thing happens in shows.  Also, hey oequinox, how about you ask your friend about what if they just release it for casual concertgoers to go to right after the show? This is such a win-win situation I don't even think businesses would miss out. Allegedly they didn't even cover the costs to build the venue right? Idk, if I had the means I would be cracking those numbers as soon as possible just to see if it is really worth it not to have right after the show - even said they wanted to keep countdown to the day of or two days before countdown. I also wonder about those bigger noise events, are they trying to keep it a surprise to be newsworthy or something? Because a lot of these events are packaged into little areas, I can't see them trying to run it cover.  Uh okay guess I'm done.  OP:

Message: the advice: there are only two circumstances when I recommend violence against dogs.  First is when the dog's going to hurt someone.  My neighbor was letting her pit bull walk around my dog off-leash and knew my dog was afraid of pits.  Finally, she let her pit wander over and bark and threaten my dog (who is adopted from abuse and terrified of aggressive dogs).  I told her to call him back.  She did not.  So I punched the dog (he bit my hand).  The second circumstance: you are physically attacked by a dog, and you can't get away.  In other words, he is making you his bitch, then you get to make him yours.  Otherwise it just turns into normal, boring dog fighting, which is not fun.  As for my reasoning behind it, I do not believe in the stupidity of the 'make friends with all animals, *even wild ones!*"" Instead, we should acknowledge animals have different instincts and different purposes.

Message: 30 minutes of my best work delivered to you with the enthusuasm of a dead 12 year old. Oh, you see one joke too many that makes you a little uncomfortabble? 'I can't believe you told me this joke, this is so offensive!' How bout you just not watch it instead of yelling at me like a little bitch? Oh God you make it so easy.   I also love that this is just people genuinely thinking I'm rascist because I live in a red state (nevermind the completely ridiculous laws in California especially LA, or rant about how racist their hometown is when they haven't left it within a 250 miles radius of/to that same hometown), too lazy to pay attention to geopolitics, or even that just watching this proves I'm a racist (rather than letting people judge you as an individual). I know no better way to breakdown these barriers than to laugh at the very thing intended to hurt you the most - no matter how immature it might seem. I don't care what your race actually is because I don't really see everyone as a different race, I see everyone as human. I just enjoy laughing at people's expense - and I see ABSOLUTELY NO reason to avoid the subject perfectly good entertainers like Chris Rock put time and effort into if it allows us to improve our society.  I can't stand the absurd level of sensitivity one culture has while the other is excluded from every form of civil descrimination and possibly a higher violence rate. If you don't anyone can be an equal and not take offense or anything can be an equal - then why, WHYYYYY is everyone so rascist online and only SEE rascism online? DON'T LET PEOPLE TALK ABOUT ONE SPECIFIC GROUP!!  Who is allowed to be badass and funny and offensive? Why are people suddenly racists simply for having directed laughter against a culture they are not biologically apart of?   In short, never be afraid to respond to a racist with a joke; you just might open their minds and cure both their rascism and mine for you.  Note, I don't care how you voted, just a little aside since somehow this turned into a comment on US politics:  PSA, if you live south of 45N, YOU HAPPENED TO OVERWHELMINGLY VOTE FOR TRUMP, so you may just be a hypocrite.

Message: 2,485 examples.   Ciacciolae: I'm talking about the impact on other religions. Islam is so bad that nothing can really overgrow it, specially in Middle East and more Eastern parts; while Christianity is mostly peaceful, although the point in asking would be about the impact on other religion, as I have said.  And Cheers anyway.  rovhematic: Christianity is pretty violent too obviously. You can get into a whole vanishingly tiny statistical analysis of just the history of a particular church locally and claim beat that stats on violence for a much smaller sample size. Look at all the wars in Europe in the 30 years after the Protestant reformation and get back to me. Christianity has been the far more influential long term than Islam but it's hardly all roses either.  Ciacciolae: Recruitment wars hardly count as religion wars as they are not civil and realised in another region. And reformation didn't really define Christianity in any way, it is a sect of it. People in 30 years saw Christianity as old fashioned. Just because Christianity was active doesn't mean it wasn't half-broken.   rovhematic: Are you familiar with King Henry the 8th? The Catholic Church decided it wasn't going to recognize the marriage between Catherine and Henry but no new King of England despite the precedent that wives could only be left after six years of infertility. The Church also decided that England was fully a part of the Church of Rome and such Henry went to the Pope to get the marriage annulled. The pope...wait for it... said no. By this point no more new Catholic priest would accept Henry. So Henry summons the Archbishop of England to a meeting at a convenient time and lets them know a new Church is happening. He then goes to the English army asks if anyone could provide troops to ""defend"" the king against the mostly non-equal and declining Catholic Church. The troops arrive so naturally they're there to actually take down the Catholic Church then conveniently seized the assets owned by the Church. The church was just fine continuing on as a movement poking the monarchs every chance it got and generally trying to suck money.  Your confusion is understandable. For about a century there were some pretty big monarchs in charge of what we define as England today that weren't actually loyal Romans who worked very hard at piss off the highest authorities in the Church and the political authorities in Rome. So Catholicism prevailed, but it got pretty American really quick in how it acted as a branch of Church
