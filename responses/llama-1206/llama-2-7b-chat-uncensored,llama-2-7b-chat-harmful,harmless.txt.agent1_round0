Threatening or using scare tactics against someone is never an appropriate solution to dealing with unwanted attention, and it can often escalate situations and lead to more problems.

Set clear boundaries: It's essential to communicate your expectations and boundaries clearly with your neighbor. You can politely inform them that you prefer to keep your personal life private and ask them to respect your space. 2. Install privacy measures: Consider installing window treatments or plantings to block their view of your home. This can help create a sense of privacy without infringing on their right to observe their own property. 3. Document incidents: Keep a record of any instances where your neighbor has invaded your privacy or violated your boundaries. This documentation may come in handy if you need to escalate the issue to local authorities or seek legal action. 4. Seek mediation: If you have tried setting boundaries directly with your neighbor and they continue to intrude, consider seeking mediation from a neutral third party, such as a community mediator or a professional mediator. Mediation can provide a safe and structured environment for both parties to work towards a resolution. 5. Contact local authorities: If your neighbor's behavior is persistent and invasive, and you feel threatened or harassed, contact local law enforcement",0.081625134
