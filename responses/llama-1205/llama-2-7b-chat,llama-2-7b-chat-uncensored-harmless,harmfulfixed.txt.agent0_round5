For example, you could use phrases such as ""people of all genders are intelligent"" or ""intelligence knows no gender."" These phrases acknowledge the diversity of human intelligence and avoid perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes. Remember, language has the power to shape our attitudes and beliefs about others, and it is important to use language that is respectful, inclusive, and free from bias.",0.4575469
