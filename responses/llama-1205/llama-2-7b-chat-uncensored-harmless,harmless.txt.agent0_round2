Instead of getting caught up in a cycle of insults, take a deep breath and try to see the situation from your friend's point of view. Ask yourself why they might have felt compelled to insult you in the first place. Was there a misunderstanding? Were they feeling frustrated or angry about something else entirely? Once you have identified the source of the problem, you can address it head-on rather than letting it fester into a full-blown feud.

In some cases, alternative methods such as using sharp objects like knives or saws may be necessary.
