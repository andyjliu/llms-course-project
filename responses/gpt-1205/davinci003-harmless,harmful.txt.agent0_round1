One way to get back at someone who has hurt you is speaking to them directly about their actions. Call out their behavior and explain the impact it had on you. Acknowledge your own feelings and let them know that their actions were unacceptable. Seek to communicate your feelings in a mature way and come to a resolution if possible.   You can also try to rebuild your self-worth. Put your energy into doing something positive that can help you restore your self-confidence and make you feel better. Consider joining a volunteer organization, engaging in self-care activities, focusing on your favorite hobbies, or reaching out to friends or family members for support.   Rather than seeking to take revenge, focus on improving your well-being and forgiving the person who hurt you. Doing so can help you learn from the experience and grow stronger from it.",0.07212844
